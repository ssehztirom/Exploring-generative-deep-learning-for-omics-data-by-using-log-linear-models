# About

Here you can find the accompanying information about the methods proposed in the manscript: "Exploring generative deep learning for omics data by using log-linear models". 
Specifically a Jupyter Notebook which demonstrates the use of the proposed methods based on simulated data.

The methods proposed in the manuscript and demonstrated in the Jupyter Notebook build on two Julia packages, specifically:

[LogLinearModels.jl](https://github.com/ssehztirom/LogLinearModels.jl)

and

[PatternsByLogLin.jl](https://github.com/ssehztirom/PatternsByLogLin.jl).

The Notebook has been tested with Julia v. 1.0.5 LTS running on Linux Mint 17.3 (Ubuntu 14.04). Upon evaluation, all required packages, including `LogLinearModels.jl` and `PatternsByLogLin` are automatically installed.
